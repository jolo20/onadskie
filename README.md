if you want to add some changes to the main design or texts you want to change just clone this repo if you want to add it to your pc and push it so i can check the changes later 
and push the files to the repository.

if you dont know how to use github. theres a tutorial on youtube on how to add git on vscode so that its much easier to use

# i added a new feature where you need to add these    
- require_once '../../auth.php';
- $pageTitle = "";
- require_once '../../includes/header.php';

# and add this to the bottom of your code
- require_once '../../includes/footer.php'

you can check the measure-docketing.php if you want to see how it looks

- login.php(unless its necessary)
- profile.php(you can if you know how fix it)
